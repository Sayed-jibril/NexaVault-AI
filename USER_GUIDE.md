# 1. Introduction

Enterprise AI Knowledge Assistant is a private Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform that enables organizations to transform enterprise documents into an intelligent AI-powered knowledge base.

Instead of manually searching through documents, users simply ask questions in natural language and receive accurate, source-backed answers generated from uploaded documents.

---

# 2. Application Overview

![Application Overview](docs/screenshots/home.png)

The application consists of two primary modules:

### 👤 Enterprise AI Assistant

Used by end users to ask questions about uploaded enterprise documents.

### ⚙ Administrator Dashboard

Used by administrators to upload documents, build the Knowledge Base, and monitor system statistics.

---

# 3. Administrator Dashboard

![Administrator Dashboard](docs/screenshots/admin-dashboard.png)

The Administrator Dashboard provides complete control over the Knowledge Base.

It displays:

- Total uploaded documents
- Total processed pages
- Number of chunks created
- Number of vectors generated
- Supported file types
- Knowledge Base readiness status

These metrics allow administrators to monitor document processing and verify that the AI Assistant is ready to answer questions.

---

## Upload Documents

Supported formats include:

- PDF
- DOCX
- PPTX
- XLSX
- TXT
- CSV
- PNG
- JPG
- JPEG
- EML

Click **Save Documents** after selecting one or more files.

---

## Build Knowledge Base

After uploading documents:

1. Click **Build Knowledge Base**
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Verify the Knowledge Base status changes to **Ready**

During processing, the application automatically:

- Reads every document
- Extracts text
- Creates semantic chunks
- Generates embeddings
- Stores vectors in ChromaDB

Once complete, the AI Assistant can answer questions.

---

# 4. Enterprise AI Assistant

![Enterprise AI Assistant](docs/screenshots/chat.png)

The Enterprise AI Assistant provides a conversational interface for interacting with enterprise knowledge.

Simply type a question such as:

- What is the project health?
- Summarize the Project Charter.
- What are the highest project risks?
- Explain the deployment process.
- Which stakeholder approved this functionality?

The assistant retrieves relevant information and generates an answer using the local AI model.

---

# 5. Source References

![Source References](docs/screenshots/sources.png)

Every response includes supporting source documents.

Each source displays:

- Document name
- Document type
- Chunk ID
- Retrieved content

This allows users to verify where the answer originated.

---

# 6. Knowledge Base Workflow

# 8. Best Practices

For the best experience:

- Upload complete project documentation instead of isolated files.
- Rebuild the Knowledge Base after adding or updating documents.
- Use clear, natural language questions.
- Verify responses using the provided source references.
- Keep related project documents together for improved retrieval accuracy.

---

# 9. Example Questions

## Project Management

- What is the overall project health?
- What are the biggest project risks?
- Are we on track?
- Summarize the Project Charter.
- Which stakeholders approved the requirements?

---

## Human Resources

- What is the leave policy?
- Can employees work remotely?
- What benefits are available?

---

## Healthcare

- Explain the patient discharge workflow.
- What is the medication policy?

---

## Banking & Finance

- Explain the fraud detection process.
- What are the KYC requirements?

---

## Manufacturing

- What caused the previous production issue?
- Show the maintenance procedure.

---

# 10. Troubleshooting

## Knowledge Base shows "Build Required"

Upload documents and rebuild the Knowledge Base.

---

## AI cannot answer questions

Ensure:

- Documents have been uploaded.
- The Knowledge Base has been built.
- Ollama is running.
- The selected model has been downloaded.

---

## OCR does not detect text

Verify that:

- Tesseract OCR is installed.
- Image quality is sufficient.
- The image contains readable text.

---

## Slow Responses

Response time depends on:

- CPU performance
- Selected LLM
- Number of retrieved chunks
- Model size

For faster responses, use lightweight local models such as **Qwen2.5:3B**.
